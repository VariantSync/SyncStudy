    This patch saves and restores the heredoclist in expandstr.

    It also removes a bunch of unnecessary volatiles as those variables
    are only referenced in case of a longjmp other than one started by
    a signal like SIGINT.

function                                             old     new   delta
expandstr                                            268     255     -13
