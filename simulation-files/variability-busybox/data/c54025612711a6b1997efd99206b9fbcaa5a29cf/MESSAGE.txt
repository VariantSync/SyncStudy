    parser: use pgetc_eatbnl() in more places

    dash has a pgetc_eatbnl function in parser.c which skips any
    backslash-newline combinations. It's not used everywhere it could be.
    There is also some duplicated backslash-newline handling elsewhere in
    parser.c. Replace most of the calls to pgetc() with calls to
    pgetc_eatbnl() and remove the duplicated backslash-newline handling.

Testcase:
	PS1='\
	:::'
should result in ::: prompt, not <newline>::: prompt
