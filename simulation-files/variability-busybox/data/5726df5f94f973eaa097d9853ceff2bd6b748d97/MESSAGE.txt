ash: let ignoreeof only affect interactive shells

Commit fb7d6c89 from Harald van Dijk's gwsh variant of ash
(https://github.com/hvdijk/gwsh):

    ignoreeof is documented as only having an effect for interactive shells,
    but is implemented as having mostly the same effect for interactive
    shells as for non-interactive shells. Change the implementation to match
    the documentation.

    Test case:

      $SHELL -o ignoreeof /dev/null

function                                             old     new   delta
cmdloop                                              359     361      +2
