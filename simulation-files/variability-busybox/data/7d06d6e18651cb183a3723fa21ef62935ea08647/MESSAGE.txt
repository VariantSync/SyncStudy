awk: fix printf %%

A refactor of the awk printf code in
e2e3802987266c98df0efdf40ad5da4b07df0113
appears to have broken the printf interpretation of two percent signs,
which normally outputs only one percent sign.

The patch below brings busybox awk printf behavior back into alignment
with the pre-e2e380 behavior, the busybox printf util, and other common
(awk and non-awk) printf implementations.
