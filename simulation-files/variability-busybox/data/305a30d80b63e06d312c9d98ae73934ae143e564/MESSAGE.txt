awk: fix read beyond end of buffer

Commit 7d06d6e18 (awk: fix printf %%) can cause awk printf to read
beyond the end of a strduped buffer:

  2349      while (*f && *f != '%')
  2350          f++;
  2351      c = *++f;

If the loop terminates because a NUL character is detected the
character after the NUL is read.  This can result in failures
depending on the value of that character.
